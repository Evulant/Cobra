# Cobra-AI
A Skirmish AI for warzone2100

This is an experimental AI specifically designed for team skirmish battles. It does perform well without an ally also.
Originally based off of the semperfi-js bot that comes with the game.

There are three personalities so far:

1. AC: Focus on Cannon/Mortar technology.

2. AR: Focus on Flamer.Mortar technology.

3. AB: Focus on Machine-gun/Rocket technology.

All personalities will use machine-guns as a secondary weapon.

chat commands include: 

need power/truck/tank/cyborg/vtol, attackX (X being a player number). Unstable commands included are friend(forced ally) and help me!/help me!! for calling for Cobra units to go to your hq. It does respond mostly through beacon calls dropped with alt+h.

This AI uses the NullBot3 standard for research related information: https://github.com/haoNoQ/nullbot
